      <p className="body-2">I am an independent graphic designer with 10 years of brand identity design experience along with combined experience in illustration, print and social media design, type design, UX and web design and front-end development, and motion graphics. I believe that creativity and innovation thrives when you always learn something new, when you push boundaries, and when  you are not afraid of failure. </p>

      <p className="body-2">I finished with high honors in my Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of the Philippines Cebu College of Communication, Art & Design where I majored in Mass Communication and did courses in Multimedia, Graphic Design & Animation.
